  Google Search Console Verification File Example

  When you verify your site with Google Search Console, Google will provide you
  with a verification file like this one.

  INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
  2. Add your property: https://eduardolandscaping.com
  3. Choose "HTML file upload" verification method
  4. Download the verification file Google provides
  5. Rename this file to match the one Google provides (e.g., google1234567890abcdef.html)
  6. The file content will look like this:

  google-site-verification: google1234567890abcdef.html

  7. Upload to Hostinger in the public_html root directory

  NOTE: You can also use the meta tag method instead, which is already set up
  in app/layout.tsx under the verification section.
